// Main-page interest map with meaningful links.
// Edit this file when you want to add, remove or rename nodes.
//
// x and y are percentages of the graph area.
// projectSlugs must match the slug values from projects.js.
//
// Link types are used both visually and conceptually:
// method   — one interest works as a method for another
// material — one interest gives material / evidence / traces
// scale    — connection through body, object, city, territory, landscape
// context  — shared research field or background condition
// tension  — productive conflict between two ideas
// medium   — one interest becomes a form of representation for another
